center point and a radius (in meters).\n *    - The radius must be a positive integer with the maximum value of 20050000.\n *    - Note that larger integer values will not be rejected but lowered to the maximum value.\n *    - Example: circle(4.89406,52.37245,10000)\n *\n *  - location - A point or a circle.\n *    - Example: 4.89406,52.37245  circle(4.89406,52.37245,10000)\n *\n *  - dateTime -
