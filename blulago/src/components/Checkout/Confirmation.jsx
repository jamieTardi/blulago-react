              <h4>Need a food package or bait?</h4>
              <p>If you would like a food package or bait that‚Äôs not a problem at all,
               we need to know preferably 6 weeks before arrival. 
               If you send us an email please say how many people are 
               for the food package (min of 3) and how much bait you would 
               like (there is no minimum order). The food package is 
               essential to know in advance as it takes time to get the 
               correct ingredients in. Please contact via
                email: <EmailSpan>blulagofishing@gmail.com</EmailSpan></p>
